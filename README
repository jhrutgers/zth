Zth (libzth) - Zeta threads

A predecessor project was called Xi, as the Greek capital symbol suggests parallel threads.
In this project, preemptive multitasking is implemented. In the same context, the Z(eta) symbol
suggests that threads are not parallel, but they explicitly yield from one to another.

GNU Pth is a great inspiration for this library.
