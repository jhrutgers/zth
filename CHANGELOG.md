## [Unreleased](https://github.com/jhrutgers/zth/compare/v1.1.0...HEAD)

## [1.1.0] - 2022-10-18

### Added

- `zth::fiber()` as alternative to `zth_fiber()` and friends with `async`.
- Defining `async` can be prevented by defining `ZTH_NO_ASYNC_KEYWORD` before
  including `<zth>`.  `zth_async` is always defined, with the original behavior
  of `async`.
- Make split `zth::fsm::Fsm` into a `BasicFsm` and `Fsm`, of which the former
  does not need fiber and timestamps to run.  As a result, the `BasicFsm` can
  be executed in an interrupt routine.
- Fix support for builds without exceptions and environmental variables to
  reduce library size.
- Change license to MPLv2.

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/jhrutgers/zth/releases/tag/v1.1.0

  switching approaches.
